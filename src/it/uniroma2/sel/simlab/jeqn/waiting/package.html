Provides <code>jEQN</code> components to simulate User Waiting Systems.
<p>It is futher subdivided into {@link policies}, {@link storages} and {@link times}.</p>
<p>There are two kind of Waiting Systems made available: <code>PreemptiveWaitingSyste</code>
    and <code>NonPreemptiveWaitingSystem</code>.
</p>
<p>The former simulates a user waiting system that allows incoming user to preempt
user under process if certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>The latter simulates a user waiting system that acts passively compared to the
preemptive one as it waits for next user request to forward a new user to the in cascade
<code>jEQN</code> entity.</p>

<p>Each type must be properly connected to a <code>ServiceCenter</code> which behaviour
supports to the dynamic of the specific type.</p>

<p>Each type can be built up by setting its properties</p>
